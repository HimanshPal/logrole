LogRole for Twilio - Create User Roles for Limited Access to Twilio Logs

## Local Development

You'll need a working Go environment. Follow the instructions here to set one
up: https://golang.org/doc/install

To check out the project, run `go get github.com/saintpete/logrole/...`.

To start a development server, run `make serve`. The username and
password for HTTP Basic Auth are both "test". This will start a server on
[localhost:4114](http://localhost:4114).
